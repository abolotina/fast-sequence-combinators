;; Recursive cases:
;;
;; The recursive cases are defined via an intermediate macro, do/sequence2,

;;  strategy* is to use an auxiliary variable x-is-found to indicate
;;  whether the sequence has a next value.

;; The solution essentially has the structure of the following recursive function.
;; It keeps two variables:
;; - outer-seq is the part of the outer sequence that we haven't looked into yet.
;; - inner-seq is the remainder of the inner sequence that we haven't processed yet.
;;
;; Then, the algorithm is the following:
;; 
;; - It looks into the inner sequence and gets the next value for x or,
;; - If the inner sequence is empty, it looks into the outer sequence and gets the
;;   next inner sequence or,
;; - If the outer sequence is empty then x is done.

;; ===================================
;; Generalization
;;
;; We can generalize a concrete example from above for arbitrary sequences
;; by using expanded clause records.
;;
;; For simplicity, suppose we have two nested sequences (for two chunks of sequences,
;; we will need to just add more ellipses). The expanded clause records contain
;; components returned by expand-for-clause.
;; In the following,
;; - the components for the outer sequence are prefixed with o-
;; - the components for the inner sequence are prefixed with i-

;;ryan: good, helpful convention

;;ryan: It would help if you listed the contents of an expanded clause
;;  record here, especially if you omit some components for simplicity
;;  (and you should). It's also helpful to connect the components with
;;  the previous concrete example.

;;ryan: Before you continue reading, think for a moment about this question:
;;
;;  - What are the differences between the concrete example and the
;;    true, general implementation?
;;
;;  Now, think about these questions:
;;
;;  - Can you break those differences down into multiple, smaller differences?
;;
;;  - If so, which differences are the most important for you to
;;    explain carefully, and which ones could you say "It's an obvious
;;    generalization."?
;;
;;  (I have a simplification in mind, and I can't think of better
;;  questions to introduce it. So think about the questions for a bit,
;;  then read on, and then come back and think about the questions
;;  again and see if you understand why I'm proposing the change.)



;; ...



;; ...



;; ...



;;ryan: You could further simplify this generalized version by
;;  saying "let's assume that each sequence had a single loop-id, a
;;  single pos-guard expression, and so on". It would eliminate the
;;  distracting ellipses, and the generalization to multiple
;;  identifiers and multiple expressions is straightforward. The more
;;  important difference to explain at this point is how the arbitrary
;;  identifiers and expressions produced by the sequences interact ---
;;  mainly, how to get the scoping correct. It would also help clarify
;;  which identifiers come from the records and which names you
;;  generated using generate-temporaries.


;; As a first approximation of the solution, we replace the pieces
;; of information in the loop skeleton that come from two sequences
;; in the concrete example with components from their expanded clause records.

;; This version will work for most of fast sequence forms, incuding the sequences

;; generic sequences, that is, sequences that are not fast sequence forms, like
;; (list 1 2 3) or (vector 'a 'b 'c). Their expanded clause records all have the
;; same form; for example, consider the following result of expanding the clause
;; [(x) (list 1 2 3)]:
;;
;; (([(pos->vals pos-pre-inc pos-next init pos-cont? val-cont? all-cont?)

;;
;; It binds outer-ids for several functions, and then uses them in the further components.
;; So if the inner loop iterates only on loop-ids, then a problem appears when it looks
;; at the inner sequence first time when it hasn't looked at the outer sequence yet.
;; In the generalized version above, an attempt to check the pos-guard for the inner
;; sequence causes scoping violation because pos-cont? is not bound. To fix this issue,
;; we make the inner loop also iterate on outer-ids of inner sequences and on an
;; additional variable, ids-ok, that says whether all the necessary ids are already
;; bound before looking at the inner sequence.
